The following tutorials explain 2 different use cases for the BioThings SDK.  The first tutorial shows a minimal use case: creating an API from a single flat-file.  The second tutorial is more extensive, and describes how to create an API from multiple data sources with automatic source updating - similar to the `MyGene.info <https://mygene.info>`_ and `MyVariant.info <https://myvariant.info>`_ pipelines.

Single data source, no source updating 
--------------------------------------

A tutorial describing the creation of an API from a PharmGKB gene annotation file can be found `here <single_source_tutorial.html>`_.

Multiple data sources, with automated source updating
-----------------------------------------------------

A tutorial describing the creation of a taxonomy API that integrates multiple data sources, and automatically keeps them up-to-date can be found `here <multiple_sources_tutorial.html>`_.

Standalone instances
--------------------

A guide explaining how to use our Docker images to run a Biothings API on your own hardware, as a standalone instance, can be found `here <standalone.html>`_.
